# Guessing Game

## Code

Main method can be found in the `MainClass.java` file. Start there.

## Compiling

```
make compile```

## Running

I set up some default arguments, either of these works:
```
make run
make good
make fancy```

Alternatively, to customize CLI options:
```
java Mainclass --help```


## Tests

```
make test1
make test2
make test3```
