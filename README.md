# Take-home test for Sapiens

When I received this test task I very excited and spent the whole weekend (3 days) working on this.

After submitting it took them 3 weeks to back to me.

I was told that they "didn't see what they wanted to see" in my solution.

They ghosted me when I asked them to elaborate.
